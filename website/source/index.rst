Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language, environment, and virtual machine centered around the principles of simplicity, uniformity, concreteness, and liveness. 

Self includes a programming language, a collection of objects defined in the Self language, and a programming environment built in Self for writing Self programs. The language and environment attempt to present objects to the programmer and user in as direct and physical a way as possible. The system uses the prototype-based style of object construction.

The first version of the Self language was designed in 1986 by David Ungar and Randy Smith, and later versions were written at Sun Microsystems, although the Self project has not been active at Sun since 1995.

Release 4.0 contained an entirely new user interface and programming environment designed for "serious" programming, enabling the programmer to create and modify objects entirely within the environment, and then save the object into files for distribution purposes. The metaphor used to present an object to the user is that of an outliner, allowing the user to view varying levels of detail. Also included in the environment is a graphical debugger, and tools for navigation through the system.

Self is available for Solaris, Linux and natively on MacOS X under a BSD-like licence; we would be very interested in anyone prepared to make a Windows port.
