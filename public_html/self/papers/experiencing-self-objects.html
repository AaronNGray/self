<H1>Experiencing Self Objects: An Object-Based Artificial Reality</h1>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Our prototype user interface for Self provides browsing and inspecting
of Self objects by combining an object-based model with an artificial
reality. Emphasizing the problem-domain objects rather than views of
those objects discards a layer of indirection found in conventional
window-based user interfaces. Placing those objects in an artificial
reality reduces the cognitive load on the programmer, by exploiting
the programmer's already internalized knowledge of how objects in the
physical world behave. Our goal is to make the user interface
invisible, and thus make Self objects and the Self world real.
