<H1>Compiler technology developed for the Self system</H1>

Self implementations have used novel optimization techniques to achieve
execution speeds up to half that of optimized C (2-4 times faster than
commercial Smalltalk systems), even though the pure nature of the
language makes it difficult to compile efficiently.

Among the techniques are:

<li><a href="papers/iterative-type-analysis.html">type analysis and splitting</a>
<li><a href="papers/type-feedback.html">type feedback</a>
<li><a href="papers/type-feedback.html">dynamic recompilation</a>
<li><a href="papers/pics.html">polymorphic inline caches</a>
</ul>
