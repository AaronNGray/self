<h1>Major Changes in Self 3.0</h1>
 
Below is a list of changes and enhancements that have been made since
the last release (2.0.1). Only the major changes are included. 
 <P>

<DL>
<DT> The <em>graphical browser has been extended</em> to include editing
capabilities.
<DD> All programming tasks may now be performed through the
graphical user interface (the "ui"). Type-ins allow for expression
evaluation, menus support slot editing, and methods can be entered and
edited. If you are familiar with a previous version of the Self
system, Section 14.1 of the manual entitled "How to Use Self 3.0"
contains a quick introduction to the graphical user interface. The
impatient might want to read that first.
 <P>
<DT> A mechanism - the <em>transporter</em> - has been added to allow arbitrary
object graphs to be saved into files as Self source.
<DD> The system has been completely modularized to use the transporter;
every item of source now resides in a transporter-generated
module. Transport-generated files have the suffix .sm to distinguish
them from "handwritten" files (.Self), though this may change as we
move away from handwritten source. The transporter is usable but rough,
we are still working on it.
 <P>
<DT> Every slot or object may now have an <em>annotation</em> describing the
purpose of the slot.
<DD>  In the current system, annotations are strings
used to categorize slots. We no longer categorize slots using
explicit category parent objects. Extra syntax is provided to annotate
objects and slots.
<p>
<DT> A <em>new profiler</em> has been added.
<DD> The new profiler can properly account for the
time spent in different processes and the run-time system, and which
presents a source-level profile including type information (i.e.,
methods inherited by different objects are not amalgamated in the
profile, nor are calls to the same method from different sites). It
also presents a consistent source-level view, abstracting from the
various compiler optimizations (such as inlining) which may confuse
the programmer.
 <P> 
<DT> <em>Privacy is not enforced</em>, although the privacy syntax is still
accepted.
<DD>  The previous scheme was at once too restrictive (in that
there was no notion of "friend" objects) and too lax (too many object
had access to a private slot). We hope to include a better scheme in
the next release.
<p>
<DT> The "new" compiler has been supplanted by the
<em>SIC ("simple inlining compiler")</em>.
<DD> The standard configuration of the
system is to compile first with a fast non-optimizing compiler and to 
recompile later with the SIC. Pauses due to compilation or
recompilation are much smaller.
<p>
<DT> <em>Characters are now single-byte strings</em>.
<DD> There is no separate character traits.
 <P>
<DT> <em>Prioritized inheritance has been removed</em>. 
<DD>  The programmer must now
manually resolve conflicts. We found the priority mechanism of
limited use, and had the potential for obscure errors.
