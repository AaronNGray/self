<h1>Self Release 3.0</h1>

<hr>
The <a href="people/group.html">Self Group</a> at
<a href="http://www.sun.com/smli">Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Inc.</a>, and
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> has made
available Release 3.0
of the experimental object-oriented programming language
<A HREF="/language.html">Self</A>.
<P> 
This release provides simple installation, and starts up with an
interactive, animated tutorial.
<P> 
The latest release is more mature than the earlier releases: more
Self code has been written, debugging is easier, multiprocessing is more
robust, and more has been added to the experimental graphical user interface
which can now be used to develop code. There is now a mechanism
(still under development) for saving objects in modules, and a
source-level profiler.
<P>
The Self system is the result of an ongoing research project and
therefore is an experimental system. We believe, however, that the
system is stable enough to be used by a larger community, giving
people outside of the project a chance to explore Self.

Self currently runs on SPARC-based Sun workstations running SunOS 4.1.x
