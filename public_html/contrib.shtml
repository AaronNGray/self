<h1>Other Self Odds and Ends</h1>

<p>This page contains miscellaneous Self-related items (mainly useful for those experienced with Self). If you'd like something to be added, please email www-admin@self.sunlabs.com.</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you have code developed in earlier versions of Self that uses
privacy syntax, <a href="contrib/privacyout.c"> this C program</a>
(c/o Ole Agesen) will make a first pass at commenting it
out (privacy was removed from th language in version 4.0).
</li>

<li> This is a <A HREF="contrib/scroll.self">scrolling
morph</A> for Self 4.0, written by Michael Huebner.</li>

<li>This is an <A HREF="contrib/sampling.self">object
identifying morph</A> written by Ivan Moore.  Wave it over an object,
and it tells you the object's ID (for use in a Self expression, if the
object doesn't have a name).</li>
