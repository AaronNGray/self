<h1>The Self 4.0 Smalltalk System</h1>

<img src="images/smalltalk.gif">

<p>The Self 4.0 Smalltalk system comprises a translator, written in Self,
which translates Smalltalk code to Self code, and a set of Smalltalk
classes.  Most of the Smalltalk classes are based on those included in
GNU Smalltalk 1.1.1.  There are `core' classes for collections and
magnitudes, but little else; this is not intended to be an
industrial-strength Smalltalk system.</p>

<p>The Self 4.0 Smalltalk System has been built for several purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide a freely-available system that may be used to teach Smalltalk,</li>
  <li>to hearten Smalltalk programmers to the prospect of learning Self by demonstrating the linguistic proximity of Self to Smalltalk, and</li>
  <li>to showcase Self 4.0's adaptive optimization technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>To that end,
we have compared the performance of our Smalltalk system
relative to ParcPlace ObjectWorks Version 4.1
by measuring the performance of several benchmarks.  To allow the Self
adaptively optimizing compiler to analyze the code, each benchmark was
run 20 times, and the best time was used for the comparison.</p>

<p>Below is a description of the benchmarks. The source can be found in the
Self distribution, in the directory
<code>objects/applications/smalltalk/smalltalkSrc</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Diff is an implementation of the file comparison algorithm in the Unix <code>diff</code> utility. </li>
  <li> DeltaBlue is a constraint solver developed by John Maloney for his dissertation.</li>
  <li> Richards is an operating system simulation originially written to test BCPL compilers by Martin Richards.</li>
</ul>
