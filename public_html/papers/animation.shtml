<H1>Animation: From Cartoons to the User Interface</H1>

<b>Abstract:</b>
User interfaces are often based on static presentations, a 
model ill suited for conveying change. Consequently, events 
on the screen frequently startle and confuse users. Cartoon 
animation, in contrast, is exceedingly successful at engaging 
its audience; even the most bizarre events are easily 
comprehended. The Self user interface has served as a 
testbed for the application of cartoon animation techniques 
as a means of making the interface easier to understand and 
more pleasant to use. Attention to timing and transient detail 
allows Self objects to move solidly. Use of cartoon-style 
motion blur allows Self objects to move quickly and still 
maintain their comprehensibility. Self objects arrive and 
depart smoothly, without sudden materializations and 
disappearances, and they rise to the front of overlapping 
objects smoothly through the use of dissolve. Anticipating 
motion with a small contrary motion and pacing the middle 
of transitions faster than the endpoints results in smoother 
and clearer movements. Despite the differences between 
user interfaces and cartoons--cartoons are frivolous, 
passive entertainment and user interfaces are serious, 
interactive tools--cartoon animation has much to lend to 
user interfaces to realize both affective and cognitive 
benefits.
