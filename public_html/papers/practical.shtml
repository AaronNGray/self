<b>Abstract:</b>
In the past, object-oriented language designers and programmers have
been forced to choose between pure message passing and performance.
Last year, our Self system achieved close to half the speed of
optimized C but suffered from impractically long compile times. Two
new optimization techniques, deferred compilation of uncommon cases
and non-backtracking splitting using path objects, have improved
compilation speed by more than an order of magnitude. Self now
compiles about as fast as an optimizing C compiler and runs at over
half the speed of optimized C. This new level of performance may make
pure object-oriented languages practical.
