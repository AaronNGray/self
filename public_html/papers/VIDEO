I have been asked by several people whether we have a Self tutorial on
video tape.  Unfortunately, we do not have a recording of the full (3
hour) Self tutorial given at ECOOP, but we do have a tape of a lecture
on Self given in a programming languages course at Stanford.  The
lecture is 50 minutes long and gives an introduction into the basic
ideas of Self.  It does not cover some advanced topics like multiple
inheritance or privacy.  If there's enough interest I could also
provide PostScript for a set of student handouts (copies of the slides
used in the lecture).

If you're interested in getting the tape (for a nominal fee), please
drop me a line.  The tape is copyrighted by Stanford, i.e.
duplication or for-profit use requires written permission.
Educational use is ok, of course.
