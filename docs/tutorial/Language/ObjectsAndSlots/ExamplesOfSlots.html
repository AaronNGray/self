<h3> Examples of slots </h3>
<P>

The figure shows a bank account object. It has three slots, named balance, deposit: 
and withdraw:. Balance is an assignable slot which currently contains 100, whereas 
deposit: and withdraw: contain methods. Deposit: takes its argument and adds it to 
the balance. Withdraw: subtracts its argument from the balance, but ensures that the 
balance does not go below zero.
<P>

In the graphical representation of the object, we can distinguish method slots from 
data slots, and constant slots from assignable slots, by the icon in the button at the 
right hand of the slot.
<P>

<UL>

<LI>	The icon on a method slot is meant to suggest a text editor. Clicking it with the 
left mouse button opens an editor on the source of the method.
<P>

<LI>	The icon on a constant slot is an equality symbol, suggesting invariance. 
<P>

<LI>	The icon on an assignable data slot is a colon, to remind you that the 
assignment message is the slot name suffixed with a colon. 
<P>

<LI> Left-clicking on the button on a data slot summons the object referenced from that 
slot.
<P>

</UL>

If you want to dismiss an object from the screen, use the `Dismiss' entry on the 
right-button (blue menu).
<P>

To the left of each button appears a piece of text (in italics) which describes what's 
in the slot. Sometimes there is insufficient room for a complete description; then, 
an ellipsis (...) will appear. Left-clicking the button always tells you the whole story 
by opening a method editor or summoning the object.
<P>

You can hide or expose the slots in an object by clicking on the triangle at the top 
left of the object; this cause the view to collapse if it was expanded or expand if it 
was collapsed.
