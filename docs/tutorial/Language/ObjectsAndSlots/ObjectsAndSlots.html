<h2> Objects and slots </h2>

In Self, an object is made up of slots. 
A slot has a name and contains a reference to an object. <BR>
In Self, all of an object's state and behaviour is contained in its slots.
<P>

When a message is sent to an object, the name of the message (its selector) is 
matched against the slot of the same name, in a process known as message lookup. 
We will describe lookup in more detail later.
<P>

What happens in response to the message depends on the contents of the slot it is 
matched against. It could be a method slot or a data slot.
<P>

A slot is a method slot if it contains a method (an object containing executable code). 
In response to the message, the method is executed, and its result is returned.
<P>

A data slot just contains a reference to anything other than a method, i.e., any other 
kind of object. If a message matches a data slot, its contents are returned.
<P>

Data slots can be constant or assignable. A constant data slot, foo, responds to a 
message, foo, by returning the value in the slot. An assignable data slot, bar, 
responds to bar by returning the value in the slot, but also responds to bar: v by 
replacing its contents with v.
