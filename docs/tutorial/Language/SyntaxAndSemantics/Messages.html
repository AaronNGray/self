<h3> Messages </h3>

There are three syntactic forms of message, distinguished by how many 
arguments are being passed (the syntax is very close to Smalltalk):
<P>

Unary messages have no arguments, and consist of an identifier after the 
expression denoting the receiver. Examples:
<P>

<PRE>
	3.14 sin	"send sin to 3.14" 
	account balance	"send balance to account"
</PRE>

Keyword messages contain one or more keywords, each followed by an 
expression that denotes the argument. Each keyword is an identifier 
immediately followed by a colon. The first keyword in a keyword message 
must begin with a small letter; successive keywords must begin with a 
capital letter. 
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<PRE>
	account deposit: 100		"send deposit: to account with arg 100"
	vec at: 2 Put: 'c'	"send at:Put: to vec with args 2 and 'c'"
</PRE>

<P>
Binary messages are used to pass a single argument, and consist of a symbol 
made of one or more non-alphanumeric characters (excluding various 
special characters). The symbol appears between the receiver and the 
argument. Examples:
<P>

<PRE>
	3 + 4	"send + to 3 with arg 4"
	23.1 @ 40.4	"send @ to 23.1 with arg 40.4"
</PRE>



<P>
When combined, the order of precedence is unary, then binary then keyword 
messages. Unary and binary messages associate left-to-right, keyword messages 
right-to-left. Although all binary messages have the same precedence, a binary 
message cannot be sent to the result of a binary message expression unless the 
messages are the same or parentheses are used to associate them.
<P>

More examples, with their parenthesized equivalents:
<P>

<PRE>
	x + y squared				x + (y squared)
	sq at: n + 1 Put: n squared		sq at: (n + 1)Put: (n squared)
	x + y + z					(x + y) + x
	a max: b min: c			a max: (b min: c)
</PRE>

<h3> Exercise: What are the values of the following expressions? </h3>

<PRE>
	1 + 2 * 3 + 4
	1 max: 4 + 3 negated min: 0
