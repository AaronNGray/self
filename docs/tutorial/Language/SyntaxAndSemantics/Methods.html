<h2> Methods </h2>

After a method's slot list (which is optional) comes the body of the method. 
This is a sequence of expressions, separated by periods. 
The value returned by the  method is the value of the last expression.
<P>

Each expression will usually be a message send (as there is no point in merely 
mentioning a literal, except as the last expression).
<P>

<h3> Arguments to methods </h3>

<P>
Some methods require arguments. The formal arguments are indicated with 
argument slots:
<P>

<PRE>
	(| :x. :y | x squared + y squared )
</PRE>

<P>
This defines a method object which accepts two arguments, accessible as x and y in 
the method.
<P>

When defining a method slot, a short form is provided. These are equivalent:
<P>

<PRE>
	add: = (| :el | addLast: el)
	add: el = (addLast: el)

	+ = (| :pt | ((x + pt x) @ (y + pt y))
	+ pt = ((x + pt x) @ (y + pt y))
</PRE>

The long form is rarely used in practice.
