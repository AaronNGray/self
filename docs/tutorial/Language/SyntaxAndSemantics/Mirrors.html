<h3> Mirrors </h3>

How does the programming environment discover the structure of an object, if 
there are no classes? In particular:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> How are slot names found?
<LI> How is the source of a method obtained? 
<LI> Indeed, how is a reference to a method obtained, given the evaluation rules?
</UL>

Bear in mind that the user interface must be able to deal with any object, including 
empty objects (no slots at all), and objects which are incomplete (e.g., under 
construction).
<P>

The answer is provided by special objects known as mirrors which have reflective 
powers (groan).
<P>

A mirror can be obtained on any object using the _Mirror primitive. The subject of 
the mirror's scrutiny is known as its reflectee. defaultBehavior defines a method, 
reflect: obj, which returns a mirror on obj.
<P>

Look in traits mirrors abstractMirror for all the possibilities.
