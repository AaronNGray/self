<h3>The module system</h3>

The transporter is used to move objects, including methods, from one world of 
Self objects to another. So, you can ignore it as long as you work with just 
one snapshot. However, if you want to give your code to someone else, or save it 
as source, or read it in to a different snapshot, you will need to use the transporter, 
and the structures it manipulates: modules.
