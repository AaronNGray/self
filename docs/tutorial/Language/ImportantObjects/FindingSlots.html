<h3>Discovering the slots in a module</h3>

In order to be able to install a saved slot into an object in a different snapshot, we 
must be able to locate that object. In Self 4.0, this means that the object 
must be reachable from the lobby by a path (i.e., sequence of data slots).
<P>

When operating, the transporter locates every slot reachable from the lobby via 
such a path (with some exceptions, listed below). Every slot should be in a module; 
any that are not are known as expatriate, and can be listed from the changed 
modules middle-button menu. In Self 4.0, there are about 16000 slots 
reachable from the lobby, and every one is assigned to a module.
<P>

Slots and objects that are not reachable from the lobby constitute the local state of 
a snapshot, and cannot be saved using the transporter. (The mechanism used to 
save morphs does not involve the transporter.)
