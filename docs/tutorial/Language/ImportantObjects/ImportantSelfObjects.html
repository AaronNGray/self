<h3> Some important SELF objects </h3>

Before going on to examine how user interfaces are constructed, we will first take 
a look at some of the objects in the Self system which are used in almost 
every program.
<P>


These include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>	nil, true and false
<LI>	control structures
<LI>	collections
<LI>	processes and semaphores
</UL>

We will only outline the most important features. Anyone contemplating using 
Self to build an application should expect to spend some hours browsing 
these and other objects.
<P>

We will also complete our account of inheritance with multiple and dynamic 
inheritance.
