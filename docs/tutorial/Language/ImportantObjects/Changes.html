<h3> A module is a set of related changes</h3>

When a module is read in, it extends the system in some way by creating and 
modifying objects. The Self 4.0 system, for example, contains 175 modules 
in the snapshot, and there are over 100 other modules which can be filed in to a 
system (including test suites, benchmarks, and the Self 3.0 user interface).
<P>

Each module is saved in a Self source file (suffix .self), which can, in 
principle, be modified with a text editor (although it is not recommended). The 
files are generated from the objects and module information in a snapshot.
<P>

This approach has several advantages:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>	The system can always be reconstructed from the module files. Losing the 
snapshot is not catastrophic.
<P>
<LI>	We can construct new systems by omitting modules. If a module defines 
changes that are not needed, it can be omitted.
<P>
<LI>	We can use conventional version control systems to manage the source files.
</UL>
