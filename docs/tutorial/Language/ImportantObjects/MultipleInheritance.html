<h3> Multiple inheritance </h3>

Note that traits oddball has more than one parent slot - in fact, it has four. Because 
any slot can be a parent, multiple inheritance is achieved through the use of 
multiple parents. When a message is sent and cannot be bound to a local slot, all 
parents are searched for a matching slot. If more than one slot is found with a 
matching name, an error results. It does not matter how many inheritance paths 
there are to the slot.
