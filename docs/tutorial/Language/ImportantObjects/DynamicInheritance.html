<h3> Dynamic inheritance </h3>

Because parent slots are potentially assignable, we have a new concept in 
Self not present in class-based languages such as Smalltalk, C++ and 
Eiffel: <i> dynamic </i> inheritance.
<P>

Using dynamic inheritance, an object can change one or more of its parents during 
execution.
<P>

Typically, this is used when an object can be in one of a small number of discrete 
states, each having significantly different behavior from the others. An example is 
the object unix, which represents the Unix system call interface. It has a dynamic 
parent, currentOsVariant, which can be set to an object containing behavior specific 
to a particular variant of Unix; this is done every time the system is started.
<P>

Dynamic inheritance should be used with caution: it is easy to construct programs 
which are very hard to understand!
