<h3> Reading a module </h3>

A module can be read in a number of ways.
<P>

If it is being read for the first time into a snapshot, you can use the runScript 
message:
<P>

<PRE>
	'applications/accounts.self' runScript
</PRE>

Or use the bootstrap object:
<PRE>
	bootstrap read: 'accounts' From: 'applications'
</PRE>

Or use the _RunScript primitive directly (this is only necessary with an empty VM, 
for example when rebuilding the system from scratch):

<PRE>
	'release4_0.self' _RunScript
</PRE>

Or, if the module is being re-read (perhaps someone has given you a newer 
version) there are several alternatives:

<PRE>
	modules accounts fileIn
	cc accounts				"with apologies to C programmers!"
</PRE>

In Self 4.0, there will be a module cache refill the next time a programming 
change is made after a file is read in; this may be eliminated in future versions.
