<h3>A SELF `program' consists of live objects</h3>

Self has no edit/run mode. To change an object, you do not retreat to a 
source file, or even to a class, you just change the object itself. This was a major 
design aim of the Self system. However, this stance creates a big problem 
the moment you want to give your work to somebody else. You could give them a 
snapshot, but how do they combine your work with theirs? There needs to be some 
way to separate a `program' from a snapshot.
<P>

For Self, we take the view that the smallest unit which can be usefully 
communicated to someone else is a set of logically related changes to a 
Self system that provides the functionality required for a new 
`application.'
<P>

How are these changes identified and communicated? We do not want to have 
every change to every object become part of a new program, as this would be 
unwieldy, causing unnecessary state to be saved. Instead, the programmer should 
identify which changes to the system are logically related. A set of logically related 
changes is called a module. We will shy away from the term `program' as it has 
many unwanted connotations.
<P>

The programmer also needs to communicate how these changes should be applied 
in a new system. For example, suppose an object contains a slot with 1024 in it. 
Should that value be copied literally? Perhaps it is the result of some computation 
(such as the width of the current screen) and should be recomputed instead. There 
simply is not enough information in a Self object to extract a module 
completely automatically from a snapshot, and the programmer must 
communicate her intent occasionally.
