<h3>Collectors</h3>

A useful kind of object when building a collection is a collector. A collector is a node 
in a linked list of collectors.
<P>

All objects that inherit from defaultBehavior respond to the binary message & by 
making a new collector list containing the receiver and argument. Collectors 
respond to & by appending the argument to the list. Collector lists can be 
converted to the other kinds of collections using asList, asSequence, asSet, etc.
<P>

Hence, a convenient way to make a collection from literal objects is using 
collectors:
<P>

<PRE>	
	(1 & false & nil & 'foo') asVector 
</PRE>

Because the & operation is fast, a collector is also a useful way of accumulating all 
the elements of a collection before actually constructing the collection.
