<h2> Collections </h2>

Self 4.0 includes a variety of collection objects that serve as containers. We 
will briefly list the more important ones here; more details can be obtained from 
the Reference Manual, and of course by browsing the system.
<P>

We will describe three major kinds of collections:
<P>

<UL>
<BR> 1.	Vectors. These are fixed-size, ordered collections.
<BR> 2.	Unordered collections, such as sets and dictionaries.
<BR> 3.	Growable, ordered collections, such as lists and sequences.
</UL>

Additionally, we will mention some of the more important messages applicable to 
collections.
