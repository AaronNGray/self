<h3> Unordered collections: sets and dictionaries</h3>

Sets and dictionaries are unordered collections of objects. A set contains objects in 
no particular order. No matter how many times an object is added to a set, it can 
be removed only once.
<P>

A dictionary is a mapping from objects to objects. The keys of the dictionary form 
a set (i.e., no two keys are equal).
<P>

Both sets and dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. The elements of a set 
and the keys of a dictionary must be comparable using = and able to return an 
integer hash value when sent hash (this value must not vary while the object is in 
the collection). In defaultBehavior is a method, identityHash, which uses a primitive 
hashing function supplied by the Virtual Machine.
<P>

Objects are added to sets using add:, and removed using remove: or remove:IfAbsent: 
(which takes a block as second argument). Set membership can be tested with 
includes:.
<P>

Dictionaries can be accessed using at: (which takes a key and returns the 
corresponding mapped object), or at:IfAbsent: (which sends value: to the second 
argument if the key is not in the dictionary), and updated using at:Put:. 
Membership can be tested with includes: and includesKey:.
