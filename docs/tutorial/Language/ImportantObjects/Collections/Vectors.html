<h3>Vectors</h3>

Vectors are the most primitive kind of collection, and are directly supported by the 
Virtual Machine.
<P>

A vector is a fixed-size collection; it can contain references to any kind of object. 
Typically, a vector is created by sending copySize:FillingWith: to the prototype. size 
returns the size of the vector.
<P>

Elements are accessed by sending at: with an integer index, and modified by 
sending at:Put: with an integer index and new element.
<P>

Smalltalk programmers: N.B.: Indexes are 0-based in Self!
<P>

Useful shorthands: firstKey returns the first index (0), lastKey the last index (size - 
1), first and last the first and last elements, and first: and last: can be used to change 
the first and last elements.
<P>

<h3> Special kinds of vector </h3>

byteVectors are restricted to contained byte-size integers (0 to 255).
