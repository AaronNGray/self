<h3>Strings</h3>

Strings are vectors which can contain 8-bit characters.
<P>

There are two kinds of strings in Self, mutable strings and immutable 
strings, also known as canonical strings.
<P>

A string literal, e.g., 'foo', is always a canonical string. The Virtual Machine has an 
internal table of canonical strings, such that there are no two canonical strings with 
the same sequence of characters. Hence, identity comparison can be used as 
equality on canonical strings. Self's identity comparison message is ==, 
just like Smalltalk. Canonical strings cannot be modified.
<P>

To do string processing, you can make mutable strings from canonical strings by 
sending copyMutable.
<P>

Mutable strings respond to at:Put:, first:, etc. 
<P>

Most of the useful operations on strings are defined in traits string. There you will 
find methods to do simple parsing, evaluating strings as Self expressions, 
pattern matching, ordering, and many other things.
<P>

One unusual feature (especially for Smalltalk programmers): when you send at: to 
a string, the returned value is a one-element string! There are no distinct character 
objects.
