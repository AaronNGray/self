<h2>Processes</h2>

Self includes a multi-tasking capability, in the form of multiple threads 
within a single Self program. Each thread is a copy of process.
<P>

The easiest way to create a process programmatically is by sending fork to a 
message object:
<P>

<PRE>	
	(message copy receiver: 100 Selector: 'factorial') fork
</PRE>	

<P>
Every computation started from an evaluator runs in its own process. The user 
interface has several processes of its own.
<P>

In Self 4.0, each process's stack is of fixed-size, allocated when the process 
starts.
<P>

These are useful messages to a process:
<P>

<UL>
<BR> abort		"kill the process"
<BR> suspend	"suspend until resumed"
<BR> resume		
<BR> waitForSuspension	"returns when the process suspends"
<BR> waitForDeath		"returns when the process dies"
<BR> returnValue		"the return value of a completed process"
<BR> this	"the currently executing process"
</UL>
