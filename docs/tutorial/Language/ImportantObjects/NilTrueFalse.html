<h3> Nil, true and false </h3>

<P>
These are one-of-a-kind objects, which are in some way special to the Virtual 
Machine.
<P>

When an object is created using a literal object expression, assignable data slots 
with no specified initial value are set to nil.
<P>

Nil inherits from traits oddball, which in turn inherits from mixins oddball, which 
defines copy to return self.
<P>

True and false both inherit from traits boolean, but each has quite a lot of object-
specific behavior (for boolean logic, conditional evaluation, and so on). Traits 
boolean also inherits ultimately from mixins oddball.
<P>

True and false are special in that they are the results of the relational primitives 
(_IntLE:, _FloatGT:, etc.).
<P>

Note that unlike Smalltalk, the names nil, true and false are not special - they are 
just slots in globals.
<P>

Note to Smalltalk programmers: the logical connectives are && and ||. Both send 
value to their argument, so can be passed a block.
