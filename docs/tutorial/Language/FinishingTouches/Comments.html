<h3> Comments </h3>

We should also add some comments. We have three places to attach comments: in 
a method, on a slot, and on an object.
<P>

Here are some guidelines as to which to use:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>	If the comment is about the implementation of a method, put it in the method. 
<BR> Comments are enclosed in double quotes.
<P>

<LI>	If it applies to the purpose of a slot, put it on the slot. 
<BR> Use the `Show comment' middle-button menu item from the slot menu.
<P>

<LI>	If it applies to the purpose of an object, put it on the object. 
<BR> Use the `Show  comment' middle-button menu item from the object's header.

</UL>
<P>

If a slot or object has a comment, then a small button (with a quote mark in it) 
appears at the left. Click the button to expose the comment; you may edit the 
comment directly.
<P>

When you declare a slot to be public, you are invited to enter a comment.
<P>

When you copy an object you copy the comments too, so don't make the comment 
applicable to only the prototype!
