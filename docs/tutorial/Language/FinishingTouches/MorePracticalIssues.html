<h3> More practical issues: saving, quitting, resuming </h3>
<P>

As you work in Self, you will create new objects and modify existing 
objects. At any point, you can save the current state of all objects in the system in 
a snapshot file. Use the `Save snapshot' or `Save snapshot as...' menu items on the 
background middle-button (yellow) menu.`
<P>

`Save snapshot' writes to the default name, which is usually the same name used 
at start-up. Saving a snapshot does not overwrite an existing snapshot; the old 
snapshot is renamed to have a .backup suffix (which may lose a previous 
backup).
<P>

`Save snapshot as...' engages the user in a dialog. The dialog allows the user to 
change the default snapshot name, and set various snapshot-related options. 
These are explained in the dialog; we will not cover them here.
<P>

You can quit the system using the `Quit...' menu item. This will give you the 
options of saving a snapshot before quitting, quitting immediately, or continuing 
in the system.
<P>

When you restart a snapshot, the Self system, including the user interface, 
will be restored to its state at the time that the snapshot was made. (Exception: 
Release 4.0 does not save the state of processes in snapshots. Thus, processes that 
were running must be restarted when the snapshot is restarted. For system 
processes (such as the user interface), this is done automatically. The state of 
suspended processes, including those being debugged, is, unfortunately, lost.)
<P>

It is a good idea to make snapshots periodically as you work, especially before 
introducing a risky change.
<P>

If you wish to keep multiple snapshots, but disk space is at a premium, you should 
investigate the compression and code-saving options on the snapshot dialog.
