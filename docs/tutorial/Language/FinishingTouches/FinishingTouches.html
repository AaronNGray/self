<h3> Finishing touches: privacy and comments</h3>

You may have noticed that the slots in the lobby or in globals have their names 
displayed in a variety of fonts. This is to reflect their intended use.
<P>

Any slot in a Self object can be declared as public, private, or otherwise 
undeclared. The default is undeclared, and these slots' names are in a sans-serif 
font. Public slots are in a bold, serif font, and private slots are in a light, serif font. 
<P>

Categories are sorted alphabetically by name. Within a category, parent slots 
appear before non-parents, and then public slots appear before undeclared slots 
which appear before private slots.
<P>

The distinction between public and private is purely for documentation. Earlier 
versions of Self enforced privacy (allowing only sends to self to locate 
private slots) but this scheme was found to be unworkable. We may introduce 
some kind of enforcement in a later version, if we can decide on a scheme that 
works in practice.
<P>

Having installed our accounts in the global namespace, we should designate the 
slots as public.
