Additional namespaces (deprecated):

<h3> More about namespaces </h3>

The lobby has two parents, in fact. The other parent slot is called defaultBehavior, 
and it contains methods applicable to all objects (such as the identity test, ==, and 
default implementations of printString, error: and halt).
<P>

Any object that inherits from the lobby can therefore respond to the messages 
defined in defaultBehavior, and access the prototypes via globals.
<P>

Separating defaultBehavior from globals allows an object to choose to inherit from 
one but not the other, if that is appropriate.
<P>

<h3> Other namespaces </h3>

The lobby contains two additional namespaces, accessible via non-parent slots:
<P>

<OL>
<DT> 1. traits contains a collection of other traits.
<DT> 2. mixins contains trait-like objects intended to be used as mixins 
(i.e., their children all have other parents, which provide the main functionality).
</OL>

We are gradually moving away from the use of these namespaces. New 
applications do not tend to add to these namespaces, but keep their traits and 
mixins locally. Examples: webBrowser, transporter, smalltalkEmulator. This avoids 
potential name clashes in these spaces.
