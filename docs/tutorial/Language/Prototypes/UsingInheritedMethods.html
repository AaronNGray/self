<H2> Using inherited methods </H2>

Sending deposit: or withdraw: uses the original methods, 
which still work,  despite changing <i> balance </i> and <i> balance: </i> to methods. <BR>

<h3> Using the methods inherited  from the bank account traits </h3>

We can now also try depositing and withdrawing funds from the stock account.
<P>

We will be using the deposit: and withdraw: methods from the bank account traits, 
as we have not altered the stock account's parent.
<P>

Note that although these methods were created when the balance and balance: 
messages accessed and set a data slot, they still do the right thing because we have 
provided suitable implementations in the child.
