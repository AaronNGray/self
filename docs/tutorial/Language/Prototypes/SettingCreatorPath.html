<h3>Setting the creator path</h3>

The name has still not changed, because although we now have a path to each 
object from the lobby, we have not designated it the creator path.
<P>

The creator path is set by using the middle-button menu item `Make creator' on 
each slot in the path. We need only do this on slots leading from an object that is 
already well-known. For the account objects, this means we only need to set the 
slots in globals as creators to make them well-known, because globals is already 
well-known.
<P>

A final touch is to set the creator path for the traits of the accounts object. We can 
do this by either making the parent slot in the bank account the creator, or the 
parent slot in the stock account. It doesn't really matter which we choose.
<P>

Now, if we make a copy of the bankAccount or stockAccount, the copy is labelled 'a 
bankAccount' or 'a stockAccount'.
