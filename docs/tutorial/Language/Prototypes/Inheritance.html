<h3> Inheritance </h3>

As we have described lookup so far, a message must match one of the receiver's 
slots. If not, an error will result, and a debugger will appear.
<P>

Inheritance modifies the lookup procedure by extending the search to other 
objects. These objects are located via <i> parent</i> slots, which are a special kind of data 
slot. Any data slot can be designated a parent, by attaching an asterisk to the slot 
name.
<P>

If a message is sent to an object with a parent slot, then the search for a matching 
slot is extended to the parent if no slot is found within the object.
<P>

If the search locates a method, then the method is executed in the context of the 
receiver of the message (i.e., self is bound to the receiver of the message, not the 
object in which the method was found).
<P>

By this simple device, inheritance has been liberated from the domain of classes 
and made available to all objects. We can, if we so choose, make object structures 
that mimic the conventional class-instance relationship, but we are no longer 
forced to do so.
<P>

Terminology:  we use the terms parent, child, ancestor and descendant in ways 
analogous to their usual meaning.
