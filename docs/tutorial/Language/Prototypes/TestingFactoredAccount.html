<h3>Testing out the factored bank account </h3>

We can verify that deposit: and withdraw: still work as expected. Also, we can make 
a copy of the bank account and test that it uses the shared definitions of these 
methods.
<P>

Note that the default copy operation copies only the local object; a `shallow' copy. 
The copy refers to the same traits object.
