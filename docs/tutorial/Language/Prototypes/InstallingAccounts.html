<h3> Installing the account objects in the global namespace </h3>

The bank account and stock account objects are prototypes; we can make new 
accounts by copying them. The most common way to make a prototype well-
known is to install it in the global namespace.
<P>

The global namespace is implemented by an object which is reached by the globals 
slot in the lobby. Globals is a parent slot, so anything that inherits from the lobby 
also inherits all the slots in globals. In Self 4.0, there are 313 slots in this 
object.
<P>

<h3>Categories organize slots</h3>

To organize the slots in an object, each slot can be in a category. Categories can 
themselves be categorized, forming a hierarchy. The category name can be 
anything - it serves no purpose other than documentation. New categories can be 
added using the `Add category' item on the middle-button menu. A category 
name can be edited by double-clicking on it. Slots can be moved between 
categories in the same way that they can be moved between objects.
