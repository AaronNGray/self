<h2> Prototypes </h2>

Self is a <i> prototype-based </i> language. What does this mean?
<P>


Conventional object-oriented languages use classes to define the structure and 
behavior of objects. When a new object is required, a class must be <i> instantiated </i>. 
Modifying an object's structure or behavior means the class has to be modified.
<P>

There are disadvantages to this approach:
<P>

<UL>

<LI>	Before making a new kind of object, we need to make a new class. Whenever 
we want to change the object's structure or behavior, we have to change the 
class. Some systems do not even permit existing objects to have their class 
changed; the object has to be reconstructed after the class has changed. When 
we change the class, we have to be sure that there are no other instances which 
require the old behavior; otherwise we need to make a new subclass. This 
slows down development and hinders experimentation.
<P>

<LI>	When we want to make a new kind of object, we don't usually look for an 
existing object that is similar to what we want, but we look for a class that 
defines objects similar to our intent. Then we have to imagine an instance, or, 
if we are lucky, we can instantiate the class and examine the object. But it's still 
somewhat indirect.
<P>


The Self language doesn't have any classes. When we want a new object, 
we find an existing one and copy it. We can then change the copy, safe in the 
knowledge that we have not affected anything else.
