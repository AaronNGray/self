<h3> Factoring the bank account </h3>

<B> Why factor? </B> 

We currently have two bank account objects. If we decide to rewrite the deposit: 
method, and we edit the definition in one object, it will not affect the other object. 
We could propagate the new definition to the other object by copying and pasting, 
but this is tedious and error-prone if there are lots of copies. We would like to share 
the methods among all copies, so that a change is visible in all of them.
<P>

<h3> Making a traits object </h3>

We are going to interpose a parent object between the bank account and traits 
clonable. This will be the bank account's traits object. Then, we can move behavior 
from the bank account to its traits, so that when we have many bank accounts we 
can modify them all by modifying the traits.
<P>

Our new traits is to inherit from traits clonable. We already have a parent slot that 
refers to traits clonable, so that's a good starting point for our new object. We can 
copy this slot using the middle-button menu on the slot, and drop it into the 
background. This will cause a new object to be created containing this slot.
