<h3> Redirecting the parent slot of the bank account </h3>

Then, we want to change the bank account's parent slot to refer to this new object. 
If we bring up the middle-button menu on the parent slot button in our bank 
account, we'll see an item labelled `Grab pointer'. Invoking this item draws an 
arrow out of the slot, and puts the head of the arrow in the hand. We can drop the 
arrow head on our new object; it becomes the parent of the bank account. You can 
retract the arrow if you desire by using the same menu (item `Retract'), or by 
clicking on the tail of the arrow.

Moving the deposit and withdraw methods into the traits
<P>

Finally, we can move the deposit: and withdraw: slots from the bank account into 
the traits object. To do this use the `Move' middle-button menu item on each slot, 
dropping the slot on the traits object.
