<h3> Benefits of mixed state and behavior </h3>

In Self, we can put method and data slots in whichever object we choose 
- it is up to us to exercise good taste and careful design to get the effect we want.
<P>

We can also use this flexibility to explore new designs in a safe way. For example, 
suppose we want to try a new deposit: method, but we are unsure of ourselves and 
don't want to break any existing bank accounts until we are certain that our new 
method works.
<P>

We can make a new bank account by copying an existing one, and put a local copy 
of deposit: inside it. We can then experiment with deposit: sure in the knowledge 
that no other object will be affected. When we are convinced our new method is 
working, we can move it back to the traits, so all accounts use it.
