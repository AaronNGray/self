<h2> What is SELF? Why was it created? Where does it come from? </h2>

Self is an object-oriented programming language and associated 
programming environment. 

It is close in spirit and semantics to Smalltalk:

<UL>
<LI>	It is a pure object-oriented language, i.e., everything in the computational domain of Self is an object.
<LI>	Its syntax borrows heavily from Smalltalk.
<LI>	As in Smalltalk, variables are of unrestricted type.
<LI>	It uses blocks - objects which behave like procedures - to implement control structures.
<LI>	Programs are constructed incrementally within the programming environment. An exploratory style is encouraged.
</UL>

However, it differs from Smalltalk in several important respects. The principal 
force guiding the design of Self was the desire for simplicity and 
concreteness. This force is manifested thus:
<P>

<LI>	Self is considerably simpler than Smalltalk in syntax and semantics. 
More of the basic facilities in the Self system are implemented in 
Self, itself.
<P>

<LI>	Self has no classes. Instead a more direct object-based inheritance 
mechanism is provided. The programming environment facilitates direct 
manipulation, in which the programmer communicates with objects directly 
(or appears to), rather than applying "tools" to effect changes.
