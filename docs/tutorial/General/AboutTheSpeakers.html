<h2> About the speakers </h2>

<HR>

Mario Wolczko is a Senior Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, and 
has been working on Self for two years. Prior to that he was a researcher 
in the area of object-oriented programming language design and implementation, 
specializing in dynamic object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk.

Randall B. Smith is currently a Senior Staff Scientist at Sun Microsystems 
Laboratories, where he is co-leader of the Self project. He previously 
worked at Xerox PARC for eight years, where he developed a virtual world 
programming environment called the Alternate Reality Kit, and, with David 
Ungar, designed the Self language. He also spent a year at Rank-Xerox 
Cambridge Research Labs, where he worked on distributed, multi-user real-time 
interactive environments. His work in object-oriented language centers on 
prototype-based systems and the notion of subjective objects. His Ph.D. is in 
theoretical physics from the University of California at San Diego.
