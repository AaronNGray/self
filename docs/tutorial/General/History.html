Self was designed by David Ungar and Randall Smith in 1986. <BR>  A paper 
describing the language appeared at OOPSLA '87. An <BR>
initial implementation was undertaken at Stanford University in <BR> 
1987. After that, Self was used as a vehicle for language, <BR>
environment, user interface and implementation research (as we <BR>
shall see, some of the features of Self pose challenging <BR>
implementation problems). A public releases of Self from <BR> 
Stanford took place in 1990. In 1991 the Self project moved to <BR>
Sun Microsystems Labs. Further public releases took place in <BR>
1992 and 1993, and the latest release, 4.0, emerged in July 1995. <BR>
This tutorial is based on that release.
