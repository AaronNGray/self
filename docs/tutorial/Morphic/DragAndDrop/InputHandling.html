<h3> Input handling</h3>

In general, we can make a morph sensitive to input events by defining these 
methods appropriately:
<P>

<PRE>
	keyUp:, keyDown:
	leftMouseUp: leftMouseDown:, middleMouseUp, rightMouseUp,...
	leftDoubleClick:, middleDoubleClick, rightDoubleClick:
	mouseMove:
</PRE>

<P>
Morphic represents user actions such as pressing a key or mouse button using 
ui2Event objects. A ui2Event actually carries two kinds of information: its type, such 
as "leftMouseDown", and the state of the mouse buttons and certain keyboard 
keys when the event occurred. This allows a program to tell, for example, if the 
shift key was held down when the left mouse button was pressed. As events occur, 
they are placed into a buffer. Morphic removes and processes events from this 
buffer in order. Thus, even if a user occasionally gets ahead of the system, the 
system will eventually catch up.
