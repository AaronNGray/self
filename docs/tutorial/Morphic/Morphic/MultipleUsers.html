<h3>Multiple users</h3>

Multiple users can have windows open on a morph world simultaneously, and be 
actively working within it. They can be working in the same area or in disjoint 
areas. When in the same area, every user can see the screen boundaries, cursors, 
and actions of the other users. We call this property WYSIWITYS - What You See 
Is What I Think You See.
<P>

A new window on a world can be opened using a button like that shown at left 
(right and below center). This requires the X name of the display. Before using the 
button, you should ensure that the remote X server is set up to allow connections 
from the machine hosting Self (e.g., by using the xhost program).
