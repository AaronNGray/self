<h1> Morphic: The SELF user interface framework
</h1>

Morphic is a user interface framework that supports composable graphical objects, 
along with the machinery required to display and animate these objects, handle 
user inputs, and manage underlying system resources such as X displays, fonts, 
and colormaps. A primary goal of Morphic is to make it easy to construct and edit 
interactive graphical objects (morphs), both by direct manipulation and from 
within programs.
<P>

The entire Self 4.0 programming environment is constructed using 
Morphic.
