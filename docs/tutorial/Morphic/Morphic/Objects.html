<h3>Objects, worlds and windows</h3>

A given user can have several Morphic windows open, either on the same morph 
world or on different morph worlds, and can drag morphs between these 
windows.
<P>

A new world can be created using the expression desktop openNewWorld or desktop 
openNewWorldOnDisplay: displayName where displayName is an X display name 
such as 'host:0.1'.
<P>

Each world has a name, shown in the window title. You can access the world 
object, a worldMorph, using desktop worldNamed: nameString. desktop worlds returns 
a list of all the worlds. To open a new window on an existing world w, use w 
alsoOpenOnDisplay: displayName.
