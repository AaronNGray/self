<h3> Kansas - a large, shared, flat space </h3>

A Morphic window shows just one portion of a large, two-dimensional world of 
morphs. The window can be panned around in this world, allowing different areas 
to be used for different activities. 
<P>

Two tools are provided to pan the window: a radar view (prototype: radarView) 
shows a birds-eye view of the world around the current location, and has buttons 
to zoom the view in and out and move around the space. A world scroller 
(prototype: worldScrollerMorph) just has the navigation buttons.
