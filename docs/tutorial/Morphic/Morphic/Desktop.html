<h3>The desktop object</h3>

Overall control of Kansas is centralized in desktop.

desktop close closes all the windows and ceases further UI activity. The user 
interface can be restarted with a new, almost empty world with desktop open. All 
activity in the user interface can be suspended with desktop stop. It can be restarted 
with desktop go, which is often effective should the user interface process crash 
(due to a failed experiment, for example).
<P>

When you restart a snapshot, the user interface is reverted to its previous state, if 
it was running. However, windows are only opened on the default display 
($DISPLAY); there is no attempt to re-establish windows on other displays.
