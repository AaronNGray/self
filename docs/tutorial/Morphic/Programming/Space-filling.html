<h3>Space-filling</h3>

For simplicity, the packing strategy was described as if the submorphs to be 
packed were all rigid. In order to support "stretchy" layouts, morphs can be 
designated as <i>space-filling</i>. (Note: The source code uses the older term, flexible.) 
When there is extra space, a space-filling morph expands to fill this space. If there 
is no extra space, a space-filling morph shrinks to its minimum size. When there 
are several space-filling morphs in a single row or column, any extra space is 
divided evenly among them.
<P>

Space-filling morphs can be used to control the placement of submorphs within 
the primary dimension when a row or column is stretched. For example, suppose 
one wanted a row with three buttons, one at the left end, one at the right end, and 
one in the middle. This can be accomplished by inserting space-filling morphs 
between the buttons:

<PRE>
	[See images] <button1><spacer><button2><spacer><button3>
</PRE>

<P>
When the row is stretched, the extra space is divided evenly between the two 
spacers, button2 stays in the center, and button3 stays at the far right. By making 
the color of the spacers match that of the underlying row, they become effectively 
invisible. This is a common technique.
