<h3>Resize Attribute Summary</h3>

The resizing behavior of a morph in one dimension is completely independent of 
its behavior in the other dimension; that is, a morph actually has two independent 
resizing attributes, one for the horizontal dimension and one for the vertical 
dimension.
<P>

To summarize, the resizing behavior of a morph along a given dimension is 
controlled by its resizing attribute, which has one of three values:
<P>

<UL>
<B> rigid </B> <BR> 
The morph is not resized.
<P>

<B>space-filling</B> <BR> 
In a row or column, the size of the morph adapts to fill the 
available space. Extra space is shared evenly with any other space-filling 
morphs in that row or column.
<P>

<B>shrink-wrap</B> <BR> 
The morph is shrunk to just fit around its submorphs, or to its 
minimum size, whichever is smaller. Enclosed space-filling morphs are 
shrunk if necessary.
<P>

</UL>

A morph's minimum size in a given dimension determines the smallest amount of 
space that should be allocated to it during layout. The core sampler and/or 
properties sheet (another blue menu item) can be used to change these attributes.
