<h3>Packing</h3>

The current set of layout morphs all use the same layout strategy: linear, non-
overlapping packing. Rows pack horizontally from left-to-right. Columns, frames, 
and their descendents pack vertically from top-to-bottom. This simple approach, 
while it does not handle every conceivable layout problem (e.g., tables whose rows 
and columns adjust to the size of their contents), is surprisingly powerful. All 
automatic layout in Morphic is based on nested combinations of rows and 
columns.
<P>

Linear packing is best explained procedurally. Consider a rowMorph. Its task is to 
arrange its submorphs into a row such that the left edge of each morph just touches 
the right edge of the next morph. The submorphs are processed in order; that is, 
the first submorph will be placed at the left end of the row, then the next submorph 
will be placed to the right of the first, and so on. The last submorph will be placed 
at right-most end of the row. Notice that the order of the submorphs is not affected 
by the packing process. Also notice that the packing is done only in one primary 
dimension-the horizontal dimension in this case. The other dimension is also 
considered during packing, and is controlled by the <i>justification</i> parameter of the 
row. Depending on this parameter, the tops, bottoms, or centers of the submorphs 
can be aligned with the top, bottom, or center of the row.
