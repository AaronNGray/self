<h3>Automatic Layout</h3>

Automatic layout relieves the programmer from much of the burden of laying out 
the components of a composite morph such as a dialog box. By allowing Morphic 
to handle the details of placing and resizing the components, the programmer can 
focus on the topology of the layout, without worrying about the exact positions and 
sizes. Automatic layout also allows composite morphs to adapt gracefully to size 
changes, including font size changes.
<P>

Layout morphs manage the placement and sizing of their submorphs. Layout 
morphs currently include rowMorphs, columnMorphs, frameMorphs and their 
descendants. All other morphs leave the size and placement of their submorphs 
alone.
