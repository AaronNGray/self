<h3>Minimum Sizes</h3>

Morphs have a minimum size in each dimension (minWidth and minHeight). These 
sizes determine the minimum amount of space that will be allocated to a morph 
during layout. 
<P>

The minimum size of a layout morph takes into account the minimum sizes of its 
submorphs. For example, the minimum width of a row is the sum of the minimum 
widths of its submorphs (plus a little bit for a border, if it has one).
<P>

The absolute minimum width and height of a morph, even when it has no 
submorphs, is specified by its baseMinWidth and baseMinHeight. For some kinds of 
morph, these values are stored in assignable slots in the morph. For others, these 
values are defined by inherited constant slots to save space. One can use these 
attributes to give a space-filling morph a minimum size.
