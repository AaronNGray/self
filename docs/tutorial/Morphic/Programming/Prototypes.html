<h3> Morph prototypes and traits hierarchies </h3>

Morphic organizes morphs into a hierarchy much like a class hierarchy. The 
behavior for all copies of a given morph prototype is defined in a traits object 
which is a parent of all the copies. 
<P>

The root of the morph hierarchy is traits morph. All morphs inherit from traits morph, 
either directly or via one or more intermediate traits objects. (Note: to see the entire 
morph hierarchy, invoke the "Show Traits Family" menu command on traits 
morph. Be patient; the morph hierarchy is quite large.)
<P>

Usually, the prototype of a given morph contains all the slots of the morph from 
which it is derived plus, possibly, a few additions. Each morph is defined using the 
copy-down facility.
