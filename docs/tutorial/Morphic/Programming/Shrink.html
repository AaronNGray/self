<h2> Shrink-wrapping </h2>
<P>
A shrink-wrap morph shrinks to the smallest size that accommodates its submorphs.

<h3>Shrink-Wrapping</h3>

It is sometimes desirable for the size of a morph to depend on the sizes of its 
submorphs. For example, the size of a button should depend on the size of its label. 
(It would be annoying if it didn't; the programmer would have to manually resize 
the button after changing the label.) A morph designated as shrink-wrap shrinks (or 
grows) to the smallest size that accommodates the size requirements of its 
submorphs.
