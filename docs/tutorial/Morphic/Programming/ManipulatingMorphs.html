<h2>Programmatic manipulation of morphs</h2>

A morph can be made a submorph of some other morph using the addMorph: 
operation. This operation updates both the owner slot of the submorph and the 
submorphs list of the owner to reflect the desired configuration. For example, 
adding morph B to morph A adds B to A submorph list, removes B from its old 
owner (if any), and sets B's owner to A. The addMorph: operation also updates the 
layout of both B's old and new owners. The global position of a morph is held 
invariant by addMorph: (although some morphs may perform an automatic layout 
as a side-effect of addMorph:, immediately changing the position of the newly-
added morph.).

Here are some other useful messages to morphs:
<P>

<PRE>
owner			"a morph's owner"
morphs			"a copy of the morphs submorph list"
morphCount		"the number of submorphs"
morphsDo: aBlock	"iterate over the direct submorphs"
allMorphsDo: aBlock	"iterate over the morph and all its submorphs"

delete			"remove the morph from its owner"
removeMorph: m		"remove the submorph m"
isInWorld		"is the morph in a world?"
world			"the morph's world (must be in a world)"

copy			"copy the morph and its submorphs"
copyRemoveAllMorphs	"copy the morph without its submorphs"
</PRE>
