<h2> Installation </h2>

We can now install our objects in the global namespace, make a module, and save 
it.
<P>

First, we open globals so that the category ui2/Applications is exposed. We can 
then drag the slot pieWedgeMorph from the chart prototype and drop it in. Then we 
can add a slot pieChartMorph, and connect it to the chart.
<P>

Next, we use `Make creator' on these slots, and on the parent slots in the 
prototypes.
<P>

After that, we edit the prototype slots in the objects to refer to the correct slots 
(namely pieChartMorph and pieWedgeMorph).
<P>

Our prototypes are copies of circleMorphs, and should maintain their structure in 
the face of changes to circleMorph. Hence, we make each of them a copy-down of 
circleMorph. Omit the slots parent and prototype when setting the copy-down 
information.
<P>

Finally, we can add module information into the new slots in globals, the 
prototypes and the traits, placing all of them in a module pieChart. At this point, we 
can file out the module.
<P>

You may even consider embedding a pie chart into the factory.
