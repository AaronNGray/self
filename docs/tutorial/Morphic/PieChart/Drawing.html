<h3>Making the pie wedge draw</h3>

Use `Show Morph' on the pie wedge object's middle-button menu to make it 
appear as a morph. We have not changed any behavior, so it draws as a circle.
<P>

Use `Move to Own Window' to move the morph into a window on a new world. 
This makes it easier to fix errors in the draw method, since the main programming 
window can still be used even if the morph's drawing method is broken.
<P>

Add the following slots to the object:
<P>

<PRE>
	baseDrawOn: canvas = (| r. |
		"X bug: zero span angle draws full circle!"
		percent = 0 ifTrue: [ ^self ]. 
		"X bug: fillArc sometimes goes one pixel out of bounds"
		r: baseBounds indent: 1. 
		canvas
			fillArcWithin: r 
			From: startAngle 
			Spanning: spanAngle
			Color: color.
		self
	).

	spanAngle = (  3.6 * percent ).
</PRE>

baseDrawOn: is the primary method used to render a morph (but not its 
submorphs). It takes a canvas as argument (an object which serves as a proxy for 
an X drawable).
<P>

We need a couple of lines to work around problems with the underlying X 
graphics operations. First, if we try to draw a filled arc with span of zero, X 
interprets this as a full circle. Second, the X server we tested this code on 
occasionally drew slightly outside the specified bounds. 
<P>

Pick up the pie wedge to make it redraw. It should show as a third of a circle.
<P>

<h3>If something goes wrong...</h3>

If you write an erroneous baseDrawOn: method, e.g., one that results in a run-time 
error, then you are likely to crash the world containing the object being drawn. 
Under these circumstances, Morphic usually detects that the display loop is 
failing, and creates a debugger on the failing process, placing the debugger in 
another, new world. However, it is tedious to repair the problem in a completely 
new world (because of the lack of context). Hence, when working on a critical 
operation in a morph, such as baseDrawOn:, it is better to put the morph 
representation in a world of its own. If that world crashes, you can still work on 
the morph via its object representation in the original world.
