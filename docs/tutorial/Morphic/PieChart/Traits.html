<h3>Making traits for the morphs</h3>

Before we continue extending the example, we should note that it is getting 
tedious to make new copies of the wedge and chart every time we change a 
method. This is a good clue that it is time to introduce traits.
<P>

We'll do this in the simplest way possible: For each of the chart and wedge 
prototypes, copy the parent slot to the background to make a new object, connect 
the original parent slot to this object by arrow-dragging, and then move the 
relevant slots (all the methods and constant data slots) to the parent. This is 
probably a good time to introduce categories, too, label slots as public/private, 
and add comments.
