<h2> Developing a new kind of morph </h2>

In this section we will develop a new kind of morph, extending the morph 
hierarchy. This gives us an opportunity to discuss how the various responsibilities 
of a morph are implemented and can be modified.
<P>

The example we will develop is that of a pie chart, made up of pie wedges.
