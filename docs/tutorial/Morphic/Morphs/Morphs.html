<h1>Morphs</h1>

The central abstraction of Morphic is the graphical object or morph (from the Greek 
for "shape" or "form"). A morph has a visual representation that can be picked up 
and moved.

Any morph can have component morphs (called submorphs). A morph with 
submorphs is called a composite morph. A composite morph is treated as a unit; 
moving, copying, or deleting a composite morph causes all its submorphs to be 
moved, copied, or deleted as well. 
<P>

By convention, all morphs are visible; Morphic does not use invisible structural 
morphs for aggregation. This means that if a composite morph is disassembled, all 
its component morphs can be seen and manipulated.
