<h3>Direct manipulation of morphs</h3>

All morphs share the same right-button (blue) menu, which lets the user perform 
various morph-related operations. We will look at the other entries later, but for 
now let's consider these:
<P>

<UL>

<B>Grab</B><BR>
Some morphs are mouse-sensitive (e.g., buttons) and clicking with the 
left-mouse button does not pick them up but activates the morph. This 
menu item lets the user pick up even mouse-sensitive morphs.
<P>

<B>Duplicate </B> <BR>
 duplicates the morph. If the morph is composite, the whole 
structure is duplicated. The copy is put in the hand.
<P>

<B>Outliner for Morph...</B><BR>
The slot-level representation of objects we have seen 
are also known as outliners. This item summons the outliner for the object 
implementing the morph.
<P>

<B>Move to Own Window</B><BR>
Creates a new morph world, moves the morph to that 
world, and opens a window on that morph on every user's screen.
<P>

<B> Dismiss</B><BR>
Deletes the morph from this world.
<P>

</UL>
