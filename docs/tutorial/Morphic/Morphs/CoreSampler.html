<h3>The core sampler</h3>

The programming environment includes a tool called the core sampler (available 
via the right-button menu of any morph) that can be used to explore the submorph 
structure of a composite morph. The core sampler shows the set of submorphs 
below a given point, the way a core sample of rock allows geologists to study the 
strata of rock at a given point. 
<P>

The core sampler allows one to use the middle button menu to operate on morphs 
below the surface and can be used to insert or remove morphs from a composite 
morph. 
<P>

Holding the left mouse button over the squares along the left side of the core 
sampler highlights the associated morph. As a shortcut, holding down the shift 
key while pressing the left mouse button over one of these squares will extract the 
associated submorph (and all its submorphs) from the composite morph. 
<P>

Holding the shift key while dropping a morph onto one of these squares will insert 
the morph as a submorph of the associated morph. 
<P>

The iconic buttons on the right show the current resizing attributes of the 
associated morph, and allow them to be changed. (Resizing attributes are 
discussed later.)
