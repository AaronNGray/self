<h3>The morph factory </h3>

On the middle-button background menu is an item labelled 'Open factory 
window'. This command opens a window on a new world containing a composite 
morph called the factory.
<P>

The factory is a kind of morph into which any other kind of morph can be 
embedded. When the left mouse button is used to select a submorph, a copy of that 
submorph is added to the hand. The factory is, in effect, an extensible morph 
palette.
<P>

Once a new morph is in the hand, it be dragged to any other window and dropped.
<P>

The Self 4.0 factory (known globally as factoryMorph standardFactory) 
includes a variety of useful morphs, from the very simple (labels and circles) to the 
moderately complex (a radar view).
