Thanks loads for your interest in being using Self 3.0!
 
The legal status of Self is currently being refined, so we would
appreciate your signing and returning the agreement below.  Our
ultimate goal is to continue to make Self freely available at no
charge. For the time being, however, we ask that you agree to destroy
all of your copies at a moment's notice. This odd-sounding request is
our way of making this trial distribution undo-able. Rest assured, the
request is not likely to be made.
 
To obtain Self 3.0 via ftp, please complete the form below and
send it to us via PHYSICAL mail or FAX; e-mail "signatures" cannot be
honored. You will receive an acknowledgement by e-mail when your
account has been opened. If you have questions or need the software
on tape, please send mail to self-request@self.stanford.edu.
 
Finally, there is a mail group for those interested in random ramblings
about Self, self-interest@self.stanford.edu. Send mail to
self-request@self.stanford.edu to be added to it.
