Sun-$Revision: 30.2 $

[ The Self 3.0 release includes VM source code, tools comprising
  the Self VM development system, as well as the Self executable
  and Self source files.

  The VM source code is undocumented.

  The Self VM development system is documented only in notes in the
  file vmUseDoc.txt.  These notes were written by users of the Self
  development system at the University of Washington.  Although it 
  was written with that environment in mind, it is largely applicable 
  to users of the 3.0 release who wish to program the virtual machine.

  To fully use the system as described below, the files in the
  "baseline" need to be under RCS revision control.  This you will
  have to do yourself.  Alternatively, you can just ignore the
  baseline/working-tree distinction and just use the files in
  their installed directories.

  "Quick Start":

    If you decide not to keep a baseline system under RCS and instead
    just use the files in the installed directories, this is how you
    can compile the system for the first time:

    1. Add the environment variables to your .cshrc file as described
       below in "Your .cshrc File".

    2. Go to self/{sun4,svr4}/debug.

    3. Do "touch Dependencies" to create a file called Dependencies.

    4. Do "make lists" to create symbolic links to the source files.

    5. Do "make" to compile a Self executable (non-optimized code
       that will include debugging symbols).

  Good luck!
